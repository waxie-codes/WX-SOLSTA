No rinse, no residue. Clean, crisp fragrance. Removes grease, ink, crayon, pencil, lipstick, black heel marks, smoke film and greasy food soils. It can be used on most any washable surface. Not for use on water-based paint, aluminum or glass.

## Directions for Use
Select appropriate dispensing mode, bottle or bucket, press button and fill.

**Floors:** Sweep, dust mop or vacuum floors to remove loose dirt prior to cleaning.
Use an autoscrubber or swing machine with light cleaning (white or red) pads, machine brushes, or WAXIE Fast Glide Mopping System for daily floor cleaning. Apply solution
to floor. Allow dwell time. Agitate and pick up soiled solution. It may be necessary depending on soil load to double scrub the surface. Rinse surface thoroughly after cleaning. Use unheated tap water.

**Hard Surface:** For surfaces other than floors, apply with a WAXIE purple microfiber cleaning cloth, bottle with course or foam-type trigger sprayer. Agitate and/or wipe clean as needed. No rinsing is required. Use unheated tap water.
