## Description
An extremely low odor formula developed for locations where odor is a concern. It works extremely fast and will easily strip all types of floor finishes and waxes including modern detergent-resistant polymers.

## Directions for Use
Select appropriate dispensing mode, bottle or bucket fill, press button and fill.

**Floors:** Sweep, dust mop or vacuum floors to remove loose dirt prior to cleaning. Mask and protect all adjoining surfaces. Use an autoscrubber or swing machine with stripping (SPP or black) pads, or machine brushes. Apply solution liberally to floor. Start with the edges to give them more soak time. Allow dwell time of 10 minutes. Agitate and pick up soiled solution. It may be necessary depending on wax buildup to double scrub the surface. Rinse surface thoroughly after cleaning. Neutralize the floor using WAXIE-Green Floor Conditioner & Neutralizer packets. Use unheated tap water. 

**NOTE:** Do not allow stripper to dry on floor â€“ add more solution as needed. 

**Bottle Fill:** For surfaces other than floors (baseboards), apply with a WAXIE purple microfiber cleaning cloth, bottle with course or foam-type trigger sprayer. Agitate and/or wipe clean. Rinsing is required. Use unheated tap water.
