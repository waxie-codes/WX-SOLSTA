VERSA No-Touch Cleaning equipment now offers quick-change Lithium-ion Battery Power Packs for the 17-Gallon and 27-Gallon No-Touch Cleaning models. Cleaners can now move freely and quickly throughout the facility at any time of the day with virtually no boundaries with no concerns for power outlets and trip hazards. This go anywhere capability improves worker productivity while eliminating the hassle of cord management. Like the VERSA and VERSA II, the battery powered models thoroughly capture and remove soils, germs and other harmful indoor pollutants. Each system combines automatic chemical metering and injection, an indoor pressure washer, and a powerful wet vacuum into a single deep cleaning system. Cord free operation is perfect for day cleaning and other trip sensitive cleaning processes. Cleans an estimated 200-250 fixtures per battery per charge.
