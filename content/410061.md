## Description
An excellent superconcentrate, multi-use product for tile and grout, carpet spotting, and general-purpose cleaning. It contains all biodegradable raw materials and is safe to use on most washable surfaces.

## Directions for Use
Select appropriate dispensing mode, bottle or bucket fill, press button and fill.
**Floors:** Sweep, dust mop or vacuum floors to remove loose dirt prior to cleaning. Use an autoscrubber or swing machine with machine brush or any grout brush and WAXIE Fast Glide Mopping System for daily restroom floor cleaning. Apply solution to floor. Allow dwell time. Agitate and pick up soiled solution. It may be necessary depending on soil load to double scrub the surface. Rinse surface thoroughly after cleaning. Use unheated tap water.
**Hard Surface:** For surfaces other than floors, apply with a WAXIE red or green microfiber cleaning cloth, bottle with course or foam-type trigger sprayer. Agitate and/or wipe clean as needed. For cleaning and deodorizing toilet bowls apply to exposed surfaces including under the rim. Agitate thoroughly with brush, swab, sponge or red or green microfiber. Allow to soak for a few minutes then flush. No rinsing is required. Use unheated tap water.
