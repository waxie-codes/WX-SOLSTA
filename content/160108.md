## Description
Concentrated, biodegradable, non hazardous, environmentally friendly liquid which eliminates malodors at their source. Use on carpets, pet stains, trash bins, garbage containers, urinals and any floor surfaces not harmed by water or simply sprayed around any room.

## Directions for Use
**Carpets:** Always test for colorfastness first. Spray onto surface at a rate of 1 gallon per 500 square feet. 

**NOTE:** It is not necessary to clean the carpet in order to eliminate odors. Persistent odor may require injection of straight concentrate into the center of the carpet. This product can be used as a pre-treatment prior to extraction or shampooing. Allow solution to penetrate for 15-20 minutes and proceed with cleaning of the carpet. 

**Garbage Containers/Trash Bins:** Spray over the entire surface and around
the containers. 

**Restroom Areas:** Mop, brush or spray onto walls, floors, tiles and urinals. 

**Concentrate Vinyl Floors and Other Porous Surfaces:** Spray, mop or brush onto surface. 1 gallon of diluted product will cover approximately 1000 square feet. Room Deodorizing: Place a few drops of this concentrated product in the corners of a room or in the base of artificial plants. 

**Drapes & Upholstery:** Spray lightly onto fabric.
