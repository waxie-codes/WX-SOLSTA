## Description
Concentrated liquid formulated with high alkaline builders to provide extra heavy-duty cleaning and degreasing power. Eliminates malodors at their source. Not for use on floor finished surfaces, carpet or upholstery, and rubber and plastic surfaces.

## Directions for Use
Select appropriate dispensing mode, bottle or bucket fill, press button and fill. 

**Floors:** Sweep, dust mop or vacuum floors to remove loose dirt prior to cleaning. Use an autoscrubber or swing machine with brushes, or WAXIE Fast Glide Mopping System for daily floor cleaning. Apply solution to floor. For heavy soil, allow 5 minute dwell time. Do not allow to dry. Agitate and pick up soiled solution. It may be necessary depending on soil load to double scrub the surface. Adequate floor drain required. Rinse well with clear, hot water. 

**Hard Surface:** For surfaces other than floors, apply with a WAXIE purple microfiber cleaning cloth, bottle with course or foam-type trigger sprayer. If deposits are heavy, let solution remain for 5 minutes to loosen deposits. Do not allow to dry. Agitate and/or wipe clean as needed. Rinse well with clear, hot water.
